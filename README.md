# Bezier Curves

This is an example of Bezier curve generation using procedural methods. The program runs entirely on the CPU, computing each pixel using Bezier curve equations.

## Quick Start
```sh
$ make
$ ./main
```

## Usage
1. **Run the program** using the above commands.
2. **Left-click** on the window to select 4 control points.
3. A **Bezier curve** will be generated based on these points.
4. **Drag the points** to dynamically change the shape and size of the curve.

## Features
- Procedural Bezier curve generation.
- Interactive point selection and manipulation.
- Runs entirely on the CPU.

## To-Do
- Implement GPU acceleration using CUDA.

## Dependencies
- GCC or Clang (for compiling C code)
- SDL
- Make (for building the project)

## Compilation
```sh
make
```

## Execution
```sh
./main
```
